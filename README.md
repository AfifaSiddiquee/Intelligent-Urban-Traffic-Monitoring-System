# Intelligent Urban Traffic Monitoring System 

An AI-powered urban traffic monitoring system designed to **autonomously detect, analyze, and provide insights** on real-time traffic conditions, vehicle movement, and possible incidents using visual, audio, and graph-based techniques.

---

##  Overview

This system is built to **intelligently monitor and analyze traffic flow** across a busy city using real-time video feeds and audio inputs from key intersections and road segments. It combines computer vision, audio classification, and graph algorithms to detect:
- Types and density of vehicles
- Unusual sounds or emergency cues
- Traffic congestion and optimal routing

It aims to support city authorities and transportation departments in enhancing road safety and improving urban mobility.

##  Key Tasks

###  Image & Video Detection
- Detect and classify vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles) in video frames.
- Start with **Haar-Cascade Detection** for basic recognition.
- Upgrade to **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time, high-accuracy object detection.

###  Sound Analysis
- Classify urban sounds using audio processing and ML models.
- Detect:
  - **Honking patterns** to identify congestion or road blocks.
  - **Sirens** to indicate emergency vehicle presence.
  - **Collision sounds** to flag accidents.
- Analyze urgency levels based on sound intensity and type.

###  Graph-Based Traffic Flow and Route Optimization
- Model the city's road network as a **graph**:
  - **Nodes**: Intersections
  - **Edges**: Road segments with attributes like distance, congestion, and average speed.
- Use algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to:
  - Determine optimal routes.
  - Simulate traffic flow.
  - Adapt routing based on real-time congestion.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** for video processing  
- **YOLO** for object detection  
- **Librosa / PyDub** for sound analysis  
- **NetworkX** for graph modeling  
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch** for ML models
